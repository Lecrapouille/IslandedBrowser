# Islanded Browser

This is a in gestation personal experience for the [Stigmee](https://github.com/stigmee) for displaying your (Firefox) browser bookmarks as an 3D island.

Notes:
- I wrote *bookmarks* not *tabs* because I never have 500 tabs opened in my browser but have so many unorganized bookmarks.
- I used Firefox, I do not use Chrome browser but I guess the process is identical.
- You can click on the picture below, to see my Youtube tutorial [![video](doc/screenshot.png)](https://youtu.be/_IjCipUK8Bk) but with real collection of bookmarks, the graph is currently not displayed well as showned in the screenshot.

## Compilation process

Prerequisites: You need a g++, makefile, openmp and the library libsfml. They are easily install on your operating system.

Step one: git clone the [IslandedBrowser](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/IslandedBrowser) repository but do not compile it yet!
In your Linux console, type the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/IslandedBrowser.git --depth=1
cd IslandedBrowser
```

Step two: organize your Firefox bookmarks and save them as JSON file:
- Move your favorite URL into folders.
- Give them some more explicit names.
- Add some tags separated by commas.
- See this video on how to open the bookmarks organizer window: https://youtu.be/ZCSd5wcHcnQ

Step three: Save your Firefox bookmarks as JSON file into `IslandedBrowser/bookmarks/bookmarks.json`:
- On Firefox, do not click on the button "export to HTML" but instead on the button "Save..."
- Save to this location: `IslandedBrowser/bookmarks/bookmarks.json`.
- See this video on how to save the bookmarks: https://youtu.be/n-aw0ZNRby0

Step four: Compile the IslandedBrowser:
- `make -j8`
- The Makefile will do it for you: it will call the Python3 `bookmarks/bookmark.py` to generate the C++ source file in `src/bookmarks.cpp` from `bookmarks/bookmarks.json`.
- You can run the application: `./build/IslandedBrowser`

Step five: Click on an URL this will open your Firefox. Click on a node this will open all URLs as child.
- Bookmarks are in blue.
- Folders are in red.

## Algorithm

Pipeline:
- The JSON file is parsed in to two separated set: folders and URLs. This is considered as low cost database.
- The folder and URL sets are parsed into a graph.
- The graph is expanded through a force-directed-graphs algorithm.

Under developement:
- The expanded graph is converted into a 3D scene.
- A spatial hash is used to fasten URL search when the user is clicking on the scene.

## Work in progress

- The force-directed-graphs algorithm is slow.
- Thinking on how to generate heigh maps from the graph.
- Generate 3D meshes and use OpenGL.
- Display URL when mouse is pointing on node

## Limitation

- A 450 Kb JSON file is long to get the graph expanded.
- I finally not sure that expanded graph looks nice. Bookmarks are not a balanced tree but looks like more a flat tree.

## Example src/Bookmarks.cpp

```c++
#include "IslandedBrowser.hpp"

void IslandedBrowser::init(Bookmarks& bookmarks, Folders& folders)
{
    folders =
